# argus-next

Argus v2: monitoring and automated deploys for homelabs, with optional companions on each host. Developed here, privately, while Argus v1 (DevinMB/argus) runs the homelab; at launch this repo becomes DevinMB/argus and goes public.

Start with [docs/design.md](docs/design.md).

## Develop

```bash
uv venv .venv && uv pip install -p .venv -r requirements-dev.txt
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/pytest -q && .venv/bin/ruff check .
cd ui && npm ci && npm test
```

CI runs lint, tests, an image build (which runs the UI tests), Trivy (fixable HIGH/CRITICAL fail) and a container smoke test.
